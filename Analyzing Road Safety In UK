The UK Department of Transport provides open datasets on road safety and casualties, and one can
use these datasets to analyze how safe the roads in the UK are.

Need to answer all this questions from the above data : 

1. Evaluate the median severity value of accidents caused by various Motorcycles.
2. Evaluate Accident Severity and Total Accidents per Vehicle Type
3. Calculate the Average Severity by vehicle type.
4. Calculate the Average Severity and Total Accidents by Motorcycle.


------------- First worked on Schema creation and data loading in MYSQL Workbench -----------------


CREATE SCHEMA accidents;

USE accidents;

/* -------------------------------- */
/* Create Tables */
CREATE TABLE accident(
	accident_index VARCHAR(13),
    accident_severity INT
);

CREATE TABLE vehicles(
	accident_index VARCHAR(13),
    vehicle_type VARCHAR(50)
);

/* First: for vehicle types, create new csv by extracting data from Vehicle Type sheet from Road-Accident-Safety-Data-Guide.xls */
CREATE TABLE vehicle_types(
	vehicle_code INT,
    vehicle_type VARCHAR(10)
);

/* -------------------------------- */
/* Load Data */
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\Users\\Accidents_2015.csv'
INTO TABLE accident
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES

SET accident_index=@col1, accident_severity=@col2;


LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\Users\\Vehicles_2015.csv'
INTO TABLE vehicles
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','

IGNORE 1 LINES;

-------------------------------------- Did the Full analysis on the data ---------------------------------


/* Create index on accident_index as it is using in both vehicles and accident tables and join clauses using indexes will perform faster */
CREATE INDEX accident_index
ON accident(accident_index);

CREATE INDEX accident_index
ON vehicles(accident_index);


/* get Accident Severity and Total Accidents per Vehicle Type */
SELECT vt.vehicle_type AS 'Vehicle Type', a.accident_severity AS 'Severity', COUNT(vt.vehicle_type) AS 'Number of Accidents'
FROM accident a
JOIN vehicles v ON a.accident_index = v.accident_index
JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type = vt.vehicle_code
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2,3;

/* Average Severity by vehicle type */
SELECT vt.vehicle_type AS 'Vehicle Type', AVG(a.accident_severity) AS 'Average Severity', COUNT(vt.vehicle_type) AS 'Number of Accidents'
FROM accident a
JOIN vehicles v ON a.accident_index = v.accident_index
JOIN vehicle_types vt ON v.vehicle_type = vt.vehicle_code
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2,3;


/* Average Severity and Total Accidents by Motorcyle */
SELECT vt.vehicle_type AS 'Vehicle Type', AVG(a.accident_severity) AS 'Average Severity', COUNT(vt.vehicle_type) AS 'Number of Accidents'
FROM accident a
JOIN vehicles v ON a.accident_index = v.accident_index
