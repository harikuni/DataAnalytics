Q. Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company.
When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id
set to the manager that left.


Solution 1 ----> using self join

select e1.employee_id from employees as e1
left join employees as e2 on e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id

where e1.manager_id is not Null 
and e1.salary < 30000
and e2.employee_id is NULL
order by 1



Solution 2 ----> using subquery

SELECT employee_id FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
AND salary < 30000
ORDER BY employee_id;
