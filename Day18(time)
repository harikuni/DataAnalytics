has precisely one first order.
Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

select 
round(100.0* (sum(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end)) /
count(order_date),2) as immediate_percentage 
from Delivery 
where (customer_id,order_date) in 
(select customer_id,min(order_date) 
from Delivery 
group by 1)

Q. Write an SQL query to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to
2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting 
from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.


select 
round(count(distinct player_id)/
(select count(distinct player_id) from activity),2) as fraction
from activity
where (player_id,event_date) in 
(select player_id, date(min(event_date) + 1)
from activity
group by 1)
