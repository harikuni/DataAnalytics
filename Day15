Q. Sometimes, payment transactions are repeated by accident; it could be due to user error, API failure or a retry error that causes a credit card to be charged twice.
Using the transactions table, identify any payments made at the same merchant with the same credit card for the same amount within 10 minutes of each other. Count such repeated payments.

with payments as (
SELECT transaction_id,
merchant_id,
credit_card_id,
amount,
transaction_timestamp,
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM transaction_timestamp -
LAG(transaction_timestamp) OVER(
PARTITION BY merchant_id,credit_card_id,amount
ORDER BY transaction_timestamp)
)/60 AS minute_difference
from transactions 
)

select COUNT(transaction_id) as payment_count
FROM payments
where minute_difference <=10;
