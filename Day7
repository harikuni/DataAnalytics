link -----> https://datalemur.com/questions/uncategorized-calls-percentage

Q.  UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a category. These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters nothing into the category field).
Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.


select ROUND(100.0*count(case_id) FILTER(
where call_category = 'n/a' or 
      call_category is NULL)/
      count(case_id),1) as percentage_calls
from callers;
